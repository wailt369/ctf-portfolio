pwn.college – Linux Fundamentals

**Modules Covered:**
- Hello Hackers
- Pondering Paths

---

## Commands & Concepts

### Navigation
- `pwd` – Show current directory
- `cd` – Change directory
  - `cd ..` – Up one level
  - `cd ~` – Home directory
- `ls` – List files
  - `ls -l` – Long listing
  - `ls -a` – Show hidden files

### Paths
- **Relative path:** Based on current location (`./`, `../`)
- **Absolute path:** Starts from root (`/home/user/...`)

## Notes from Challenges

### Challenge: `hello-world`
- Practiced echoing text and basic commands
- Used `echo "Hello"` and `ls`

### Challenge: `cd-master`
- Learned how to use `cd` with relative/absolute paths
- Mistaken paths like `cd documents` failed until corrected to `cd Documents`

### Challenge: `pwd-check`
- Used `pwd` to confirm current directory before running a script

## What I Learned
- Navigating in a terminal isn't scary anymore.
- Always double-check paths — Linux is case-sensitive.
- `cd ~` and `cd -` are life-savers when moving around.
